Build Process:

(1.0) prepare the machine

- image the latest version of ArchLinux-Arm to your SD card
- create a 512MB swap partition
- use gparted or some other tool to expand the SECOND partition
- boot the machine with network access
- get networking working; it should already be configured for basic dhcp
- take note of what IP the dhcp server gave the machine
- edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow root ssh access
- restart sshd

(2.0) configure the machine

- if you're feeling risky reconfigure everything with site.yml
- if you're not configure the machine with joey-pi.yml or a limit directive

What needs done:

- set the hostname in /etc/hostname
- set localtime by linking /usr/share/zoneinfo/... to /etc/localtime
- add required locales in /etc/locale.gen
- add settings to /etc/locale.conf
- create admin users; me
- configure the network properly; use systemd-networkd with dhcp
- rename network interfaces; this should already be done
- rename the sdcard /dev node to something less stupid
- create the /etc/skel directory
- change the motd to something less stupid; change daily

- install core packages
	- dns utilities 
	- network utilities
	- sudo
	- vim
	- wget
	- curl
	- rsync
	- python 3
	- perl
	- zsh; possibly

- from here roles should be able to take over
